# Donation-Webiste-Payment
It is a donation website for poor children who can't afford the school,colleges and studies on their own, so we are collecting funds for them.
Here we have a simple UI where a user can navigate to home page and click on donate button in order to fill their details including amount of money they want to dontae.
once they click on donate they will be redirected to payoal payment gateway and they can login from their paypal account and donate the amount once the transaction succesfully they will get the invoice details incuding transaction id, amount.

I have used sandbox account credentials to check for the correctness of payment gateway,
User can also contact us by clicking on contact us page and can submit the query or feedback.
All these details are getting stored in database which is remotemysql.com.
These are the listed langauges that I have used.
